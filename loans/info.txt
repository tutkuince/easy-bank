Running a Spring Boot app as a container using Buildpacks

Steps to be followed
1) Add the configurations like mentioned on the right hand side inside the pom.xml Make sure to pass the image name details
    - <image><name>tutkuince/${project.artifactId}:s4</name></image>
2) Run the maven command "mvn spring-boot:build-image" from the location where pom.xml is present to generate the docker image
without the need of Dockerfile
3) Execute the docker command "docker run -p 8090:8090 tutkuince/loans:s4". This will start the docker container based on the docker image name
and port mapping provided.

Buildpacks
Cloud Native Buildpacks offer an alternative approach to Dockerfiles, prioritizing consistency, security, performance, and governance.
With Buildpacks, developers can automatically generate production-ready OCI images from their application source code
without the need to write a Dockerfile.
