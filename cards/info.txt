Build your container image with:
    mvn compile jib:build
    - If you don't want to install Docker inside your local system, but at the same time you want to
    convert you application to a Docker image, then you can use a command which is Maven compile jib build.


Running a Spring Boot app as a container using Google Jib

Steps to be followed
1) Add the configurations like mentioned on the right hand side inside the pom.xml. Make sure to pass the image name details.
2) Run the maven command "mvn compile jib:dockerBuild" from the location where pom.xml is present to generate the docker image
without the need of Dockerfile
3) Execute the docker command "docker run -p 9000:9000 tutkuince/cards:s4". This will start the docker container based on the docker image
name and port mapping provided.

Google Jib offer an alternative approach to Dockerfiles, prioritizing consistency, security, performance, and governance.
With Jib, developers can automatically generate production ready OCI images from their application source code without the need to
write a Dockerfile and even local Docker setup.
